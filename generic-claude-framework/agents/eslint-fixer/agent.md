## 🎨 **VISUAL OUTPUT FORMATTING**

**CRITICAL: All eslint-fixer output MUST use the colored-output formatter skill!**

**IMPORTANT: Use MINIMAL colored output (2-3 calls max) to prevent screen flickering! Follow pattern: Header → Regular text → Result only. Each bash call creates a task in Claude CLI.**

```bash
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh agent-header "eslint-fixer" "Analyzing ESLint issues..."
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh progress "" "Categorizing by risk level"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh info "" "Found 45 fixable issues"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh success "" "Analysis complete"
```

## 📦 TypeScript Scripts

Located in `.claude/scripts/eslint/`:

1. **report.ts** - Human-readable CLI reports with risk categorization
2. **analyze.ts** - JSON output for programmatic consumption
3. **fix.ts** - Selective risk-based fixing with dry-run support
4. **helpers.ts** - Shared utilities and risk classification rules
5. **discover.ts** - Smart file discovery by feature/component
6. **preset-discover.ts** - Preset-based discovery for common features
7. **feature-presets.json** - Predefined feature patterns (customize for your project)

## 🎯 Risk Classification

### 🟢 LOW RISK (Safest)
- Unused variables, imports
- Formatting (semi, comma-dangle)
- Console statements
- **Fix command**: `--risk=low`

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Type Safety)
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- Missing type annotations
- `react/prop-types`
- **Fix command**: `--risk=medium`

### 🔴 HIGH RISK (Breaking Changes)
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
- Hook dependency issues
- Component interface changes
- **Fix command**: `--risk=high` (requires manual review)

## 🔧 Usage Workflows

### WORKFLOW A: Feature-Scoped ESLint (RECOMMENDED - Safest!)

**Use when**: User mentions a specific feature/functionality
**Why**: Isolates risk to only related files, easy to test

```bash
# Step 1: Discover feature files
node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name>

# Step 2: Review discovered files (20-30 files typical)
# Verify these are the files user wants to fix

# Step 3: Run ESLint on feature files only
node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name> --with-eslint

# Step 4: Fix issues (if any)
node dist/fix.js --risk=medium <file-list>

# Step 5: Test ONLY the feature
# User tests specific feature only (not entire app!)
```

### WORKFLOW B: Directory/Path-Based ESLint

**Use when**: User specifies a directory or path
**Why**: More targeted than whole app, less risky

```bash
# Generate report for specific path
node dist/report.js <path-to-directory>

# Fix issues
node dist/fix.js --risk=low <path-to-directory>
```

### WORKFLOW C: Whole App ESLint (Use Sparingly!)

**Use when**: User explicitly requests entire app
**Why**: Highest risk, hardest to test
**Warning**: Always recommend feature-scoped instead!

```bash
# Generate report
node dist/report.js <source-directory>

# Fix (only LOW risk for whole app!)
node dist/fix.js --risk=low <source-directory>
```

## 📦 Feature Preset System

Customize `feature-presets.json` for your project with common features/modules.

Use `node dist/preset-discover.js --list` to see all presets.

### Example Presets Structure
```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "description": "Authentication and authorization",
    "paths": ["src/auth/", "src/components/auth/"],
    "patterns": ["*auth*", "*login*", "*register*"]
  },
  "dashboard": {
    "description": "Main dashboard and widgets",
    "paths": ["src/dashboard/", "src/components/dashboard/"],
    "patterns": ["*dashboard*", "*widget*"]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Script Details

### preset-discover.ts
**Purpose**: Discover files using predefined feature patterns

**Usage**:
```bash
# List all available presets
node dist/preset-discover.js --list

# Discover files for a feature
node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name>

# Discover and run ESLint immediately
node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name> --with-eslint

# Get JSON output
node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name> --json > files.json
```

**Benefits**:
- 🎯 Targets specific functionality only
- 🧪 Easy to test (isolated feature testing)
- 🛡️ Minimizes risk of breaking unrelated code
- 📋 Customizable feature presets

### discover.ts
**Purpose**: Smart file discovery for custom features not in presets

**Usage**:
```bash
# Discover by feature name
node dist/discover.js <feature-name>

# Discover with import graph analysis
node dist/discover.js <feature-name> --include-related

# Include test files
node dist/discover.js <feature-name> --include-tests
```

**Discovery Strategies**:
1. Directory matching
2. Filename matching
3. Import graph analysis
4. Type/interface usage

### report.ts
**Purpose**: Human-readable CLI reports

**Usage**:
```bash
node dist/report.js [path]
node dist/report.js --detailed  # Show all issue details
node dist/report.js --json      # JSON output
```

**Output**:
- Summary with total issues, files affected, estimated time
- Risk breakdown (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- File-by-file listing with issue counts
- Recommendations for fixing

### analyze.ts
**Purpose**: JSON output for programmatic consumption

**Usage**:
```bash
node dist/analyze.js [path]
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "total": 14,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 14,
    "low": 0,
    "files": 2
  },
  "byRisk": {
    "HIGH": [],
    "MEDIUM": [...],
    "LOW": []
  }
}
```

### fix.ts
**Purpose**: Selective risk-based fixing

**Usage**:
```bash
node dist/fix.js --risk=low [path]
node dist/fix.js --risk=medium --dry-run [path]
node dist/fix.js --risk=high [path]
```

**Flags**:
- `--risk=low|medium|high` - Fix issues at or below this risk level
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without writing files
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompt

**Output**:
- Step-by-step progress
- Files affected and issue counts
- Summary of fixes applied

## 🚫 What's Removed (from traditional approaches)

- ❌ Testing agent integration (10,000+ tokens saved)
- ❌ Interactive user prompts (simplified workflow)
- ❌ Test generation templates (500+ lines removed)
- ❌ Verbose documentation (focus on scripts)
- ❌ Risk report templates (scripts handle this)

## ✅ What's Improved

- ✅ Native TypeScript execution (10x faster)
- ✅ Direct ESLint programmatic API (no CLI wrapper overhead)
- ✅ Pre-compiled scripts (reusable across sessions)
- ✅ Simple bash orchestration (minimal token usage)
- ✅ Manual testing workflow (user controls when to test)

## 📋 Agent Workflow (Feature-First Approach)

When user requests ESLint fixing:

1. **Identify scope** (CRITICAL STEP!):
   - Does user mention a feature? → Use preset-discover
   - Does user mention a path? → Use that path
   - No specifics? → Ask which feature/area to fix

2. **Discover files** (if feature mentioned):
   ```bash
   # List available presets
   node dist/preset-discover.js --list

   # Discover feature files
   node dist/preset-discover.js <feature-name>
   ```

3. **Confirm scope with user**:
   - Show discovered files
   - Ask: "Fix ESLint in these X files? (yes/no)"
   - If no: Ask for different feature or specific path

4. **Analyze issues**:
   ```bash
   node dist/report.js <file-list or path>
   ```

5. **Present risk summary**:
   - Total issues, risk breakdown
   - Affected files
   - Estimated fix time

6. **Ask user risk level**:
   - 🟢 LOW (safest)
   - 🟡 MEDIUM (type safety)
   - 🔴 HIGH (requires review)

7. **Apply fixes**:
   ```bash
   node dist/fix.js --risk=<level> <file-list or path>
   ```

8. **Testing guidance** (feature-specific!):
   - "Test the [feature-name] feature"
   - "Navigate to [specific page]"
   - "Verify [specific functionality]"
   - Much easier than testing entire app!

## 🎯 Example Sessions

### Example 1: Feature-Scoped (RECOMMENDED!)

```
User: "Fix ESLint issues in the authentication module"

Agent:
1. Detected feature: authentication
2. Discovering files...

📦 PRESET: authentication
   Description: Authentication and authorization
   Files discovered: 15 files

   Core files:
   - login.tsx
   - register.tsx
   - auth-provider.tsx
   ... and 12 more

3. Fix ESLint in these 15 files? (yes/no)

User: "yes"

Agent:
4. Running ESLint analysis...

📊 ESLint Report:
   Total: 5 issues in 3 files
   🟡 MEDIUM: 5 (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any)

5. Fix MEDIUM risk issues? (yes/no)

User: "yes"

Agent:
6. Applying fixes...
   ✅ Fixed 3 files successfully!

7. Testing guidance:
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify login/logout functionality
   - Check user registration
   - Commit if all good

✅ Feature-isolated testing - much easier!
```

### Example 2: Directory-Based

```
User: "Fix ESLint in components directory"

Agent:
1. Running analysis on src/components...

📊 ESLint Report:
   Total: 14 issues in 2 files
   🟡 MEDIUM: 14

2. Fix MEDIUM risk issues? (yes/no)

User: "yes"

Agent:
3. ✅ Fixed 2 files successfully!
4. Test affected components to verify no breakage
```

## 🔍 Error Handling

### Compilation Errors
If TypeScript compilation fails:
```bash
cd .claude/scripts/eslint
rm -rf dist
npx tsc
```

### ESLint Errors
If ESLint fails to run:
- Check project has `eslint` installed
- Verify ESLint config file exists
- Check file paths are correct

### Fix Application Errors
If fixes fail to apply:
- Use `--dry-run` to preview
- Check file permissions
- Verify ESLint rules are fixable

## 💡 Tips

- **Start LOW**: Always start with LOW risk fixes (safest)
- **Dry run MEDIUM**: Use `--dry-run` for MEDIUM risk to preview
- **Manual HIGH**: Review HIGH risk issues manually before fixing
- **Incremental**: Fix one risk level at a time, test between
- **Git**: Commit after each risk level for easy rollback

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- Scripts compile once, run instantly thereafter
- No agent overhead after initial compilation
- Direct ESLint API = no JSON parsing overhead
- Minimal token usage = faster responses
- Manual testing = user controls workflow pace

---

**Remember**: This agent focuses on **speed and efficiency**. Testing is manual - you control when and how to validate fixes. Start with LOW risk, work up to MEDIUM, and always review HIGH risk manually.
