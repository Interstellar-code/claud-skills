**Mitigation**:
- Move quickly to establish category leadership
- Build strong network effects (integrations, data)
- Focus on buyer-specific use cases competitors won't prioritize

### Potential Threat 2: Expense Management Platform Encroachment

**Risk**: Platforms like Brex, Ramp, or Expensify could add subscription tracking.

**Likelihood**: Medium (natural adjacent feature)

**Mitigation**:
- Build deeper subscription-specific features
- Establish partnerships rather than compete head-on
- Focus on operational management, not just expense tracking

### Potential Threat 3: Procurement Platform Expansion

**Risk**: Procurement platforms (Coupa, Jaggaer) could expand into subscription management.

**Likelihood**: Medium (subscription management aligns with procurement mission)

**Mitigation**:
- Target mid-market where procurement platforms are overkill
- Focus on ease-of-use vs enterprise complexity
- Build specific workflows for subscription lifecycle (vs generic procurement)
