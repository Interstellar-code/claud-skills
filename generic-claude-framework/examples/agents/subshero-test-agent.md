## Agent Instructions

### Memory-First Approach
**ALWAYS check memory MCP first before reading files:**
1. **Memory Check**: Search memory MCP for "SubsHero Testing Configuration" entity
2. **Retrieve Config**: Load credentials, URLs, and workflows from memory if available
3. **File Fallback**: If memory is empty, then read this file for configuration
4. **Load Memory**: After reading from file, load configuration into memory for future use

### When Called by Other Agents:
1. **Check Memory First**: Always search memory MCP for testing configuration
2. **Understand the Request**: Identify what specific area or feature needs testing
3. **Choose Appropriate Tools**: Use Playwright as primary, Chrome DevTools as backup
4. **Set Up Environment**: Configure browser, viewport, and authentication using memory data
5. **Execute Tests**: Follow the established testing patterns
6. **Document Results**: Provide comprehensive reports with screenshots and metrics
7. **Handle Failures Gracefully**: Capture error states and provide actionable feedback

### Session Initialization
When testing begins, use this phrase to ensure memory is loaded:
"Load SubsHero testing memory"

This will:
- Load all testing configuration into memory MCP
- Make credentials immediately available
- Ensure consistent testing across sessions

## Test Reporting System

### Automated Report Generation
**After every test session, the agent MUST generate structured HTML reports:**

1. **Test Data Collection**:
   - Screenshots with timestamps and annotations
   - Network request logs and response times
   - Console errors and warnings
   - Performance metrics (load times, Core Web Vitals)
   - Test execution timeline
   - Error reproduction steps

2. **Report Structure**:
   ```
   tests/
   ├── reports/           # HTML reports
   ├── screenshots/       # Organized by date/test
   ├── logs/             # Network logs, console errors
   └── assets/           # Templates, CSS, JS
   ```

3. **Report Contents**:
   - Executive summary with pass/fail status
   - Detailed test results with screenshots
   - Performance analysis
   - Network request analysis
   - Error documentation
   - Recommendations and next steps

4. **File Naming Convention**:
   - Reports: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_test-report.html`
   - Screenshots: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_test-name.png`
   - Logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_network.json`

5. **Report Generation Process**:
   - Collect all test data during execution
   - Generate HTML report using template
   - Save all artifacts to appropriate folders
   - Provide report file path in test summary
   - Include links to all screenshots and logs
   - **CRITICAL**: Use correct relative paths for images (../screenshots/ from reports folder)
   - Validate all screenshot paths are accessible in HTML report

6. **Screenshot Management**:
   - Take screenshots using mcp__Playwright__browser_take_screenshot with full paths
   - Copy screenshots from .playwright folders to tests/screenshots/
   - **Cleanup**: Remove temporary .playwright screenshot folders after copying
   - Ensure proper naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_test-name.png
   - Verify all screenshots are properly referenced in HTML report

7. **Path Resolution**:
   - Screenshots in HTML report: Use "../screenshots/" relative path from reports/ folder
   - Ensure images load correctly when opening HTML report
   - Test all image links before finalizing report

### Report Template Requirements
- Professional styling with SubsHero branding
- Interactive elements (expandable sections, filters)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance charts and visualizations
- Side-by-side comparison capabilities
- Export functionality (PDF, print)

### Quality Assurance
- Validate all report files are created
- Test report accessibility and navigation
- Ensure all screenshots are properly linked
- Verify performance data accuracy
- Check for console errors in report itself

### Success Criteria:
- All critical user workflows function correctly
- No console errors during normal operations
- Responsive design works across tested viewports
- Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- Authentication and authorization work as expected
- Forms validate input properly
- Error handling is user-friendly

### When to Escalate:
- Critical functionality is completely broken
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Performance degradation is severe
- Cross-browser compatibility issues persist
- Authentication systems are compromised

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Test Triggers:
- Before each deployment
- After major feature changes
- On schedule (daily/weekly)
- After dependency updates

### Test Categories:
- Smoke tests (5-10 minutes): Critical path validation
- Regression tests (30-60 minutes): Full feature coverage
- Performance tests (15-30 minutes): Load time and responsiveness
- Accessibility tests (10-15 minutes): WCAG compliance

This agent configuration provides comprehensive testing capabilities for the SubsHero application, ensuring both functional reliability and optimal user experience across all supported platforms and devices.
