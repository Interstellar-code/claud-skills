# Topic Plan: TodoWrite Integration Test

**Created**: 2025-10-24 07:21
**Topic ID**: `todowrite-integration-test`
**Status**: In Progress
**PM Orchestrator Version**: 1.0.0
**State Files Location**: `.claude/agents/state/csprojecttask/topics/todowrite-integration-test/`

---

## 📋 Overview

**Description**:
Create a simple README.md file for the csprojecttask orchestration system to test the TodoWrite integration without requiring complex implementation. This is a test topic designed to verify that TodoWrite tasks appear correctly in Claude CLI during orchestration.

**Goal/Objective**:
Test all 6 TodoWrite integration points by going through Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, execution, and finalization. Verify that orchestration tasks display correctly in the Claude Code sidebar with proper status updates.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] README.md created in deliverables folder with all 3 required sections
- [ ] TodoWrite Phase 1 task appears in Claude CLI
- [ ] TodoWrite Phase 2 task updates to in_progress correctly
- [ ] TodoWrite Phase 3 task updates to in_progress correctly
- [ ] TodoWrite sub-agent task appears for test-agent-simple
- [ ] TodoWrite QA validation task appears
- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks marked completed at finalization

## 📄 Requirements

### Features/Functionality

1. **Create README.md Documentation**
   - Details: Simple documentation file explaining csprojecttask orchestrator (What it does, How to use, Example usage)
   - Priority: High
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - README.md created in deliverables folder
     - Contains all 3 sections (What, How, Example)
     - Markdown formatting is correct
     - File is under 200 lines

### Technical Constraints (if any)

- Format: Markdown (.md)
- Location: `Project-tasks/todowrite-integration-test/deliverables/README.md`
- Agent: test-agent-simple (documentation creation specialist)
- Time: Should complete in < 2 minutes

### Assumptions Made

- **Simple task is sufficient for TodoWrite testing** - Reason: Complex implementation would obscure TodoWrite integration verification
- **test-agent-simple agent exists** - Reason: Spec specifies this agent for the task

### Reference Documents

- **User Request**: "Create a topic using test-todowrite-integration.md to test TodoWrite integration"
- **Spec File**: `./spec/original-spec.md`
- **Additional Context**: This is a test topic specifically designed to validate TodoWrite integration points without complex implementation work

## 🤖 Agent Selection

### Agents to REUSE (from library)

- ✅ **test-agent-simple**
  - **Specialization**: Simple documentation creation and testing agent
  - **Previously Used In**: N/A (new agent)
  - **Assigned To**: Task 001
  - **Reason for Reuse**: Designed specifically for simple test tasks like this

- ✅ **deliverables-qa-validator**
  - **Specialization**: Quality assurance validation of topic deliverables
  - **Previously Used In**: Multiple topics (standard QA agent)
  - **Assigned To**: Task 002
  - **Reason for Reuse**: Standard QA validation agent for all topics

### Agents CREATED NEW (for this topic)

None - All agents reused from library

**Total Agents**: 2 (2 reused, 0 new)

---

## 🎯 Execution Plan

### Execution Strategy

- **Total Tasks**: 2 (1 feature task + 1 QA validation)
- **Execution Mode**: Sequential (Task 001 first, then Task 002 after completion)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-5 minutes total (< 2 min for README, < 2 min for QA)
- **Critical Path**: task-001 → task-002 (QA validation depends on README creation)

### Task Breakdown

#### Task 001: Create csprojecttask README.md Documentation

- **Agent**: `test-agent-simple`
- **Dependencies**: None (ready to launch immediately)
- **Priority**: High
- **Focus Area**: Create comprehensive README.md documentation explaining the csprojecttask orchestration system
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Project-tasks/todowrite-integration-test/deliverables/README.md` - Documentation file with 3 required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] README.md created in deliverables folder
  - [ ] Contains "What it does" section (explains csprojecttask orchestrator)
  - [ ] Contains "How to use" section (step-by-step usage)
  - [ ] Contains "Example usage" section (real-world example)
  - [ ] Markdown formatting is correct (no syntax errors)
  - [ ] File is under 200 lines
  - [ ] File tracked in state file filesCreated array

#### Task 002: QA Validation & Deliverables Check (FINAL)

- **Agent**: `deliverables-qa-validator`
- **Dependencies**: Task 001 (must complete first - waits for README.md creation)
- **Priority**: High
- **Focus Area**: Validate README.md deliverable against topic plan and specification, generate comprehensive QA report
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Project-tasks/todowrite-integration-test/QA-REPORT.md` - Comprehensive validation report
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] All requirements from topicplan.md validated
  - [ ] README.md existence verified
  - [ ] README.md content quality checked (all 3 sections present)
  - [ ] Markdown formatting validated
  - [ ] QA-REPORT.md created with clear pass/fail verdict
  - [ ] All success criteria from topic plan checked

## 📝 Additional Notes

**Test-Specific Notes**:
- This is a minimal test topic designed to verify TodoWrite integration
- The task is intentionally simple (single README.md creation)
- Focus is on verifying all 6 TodoWrite integration points work correctly
- Expected to complete quickly (< 5 minutes total)

**TodoWrite Integration Points Being Tested**:
1. Topic Initialization (Phase 1 start)
2. Phase 1 Complete (after requirements approval)
3. Phase 2 Complete (after agent selection approval)
4. Phase 3 Complete (after execution plan approval)
5. Sub-Agent Task Creation (when launching test-agent-simple)
6. Topic Finalization (QA callback completion)
