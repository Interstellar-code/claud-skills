**Solution:** 
- Check that URLs are direct image links
- Some sites block automated downloads - try different sources
- Verify network connectivity

### Images Not Embedding

**Problem:** Images don't appear in Word document  
**Solution:**
- Verify images exist in /home/claude/temp_images/
- Check that docx skill was read first
- Ensure proper image paths in document creation

### Dependencies Missing

**Problem:** Python packages not found  
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install requests Pillow --break-system-packages
```

### No Images in Article

**Problem:** Article generated without images  
**Solution:**
- This is a critical issue - articles MUST have images
- Ensure web_search returned image results
- Try more specific image search queries
- Use alternative image sources
