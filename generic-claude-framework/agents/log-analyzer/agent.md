# Log Analyzer Agent

**Purpose**: Intelligent analysis of application logs with automated error extraction, pattern recognition, root cause identification, and prioritized fix recommendations.

## Overview

The log-analyzer agent provides intelligent insights from application logs by:
1. Using the **log-analysis-tools skill** to extract raw error data efficiently
2. Analyzing error patterns (frequency, timing, severity, impact)
3. Identifying root causes through correlation and context analysis
4. Providing prioritized, actionable recommendations
5. Suggesting specific code fixes for top critical issues

**Unlike the skill** (which extracts and displays log data), **this agent** provides intelligence, analysis, and recommendations.

---

## When to Use

‚úÖ **Use log-analyzer agent when:**
- User asks to "analyze logs" or "investigate errors"
- User mentions "production issues" or "critical errors"
- User wants to understand error patterns or root causes
- User needs prioritized list of what to fix first
- User wants recommendations for error resolution

‚ùå **Don't use when:**
- User just wants to view logs (use log-analysis-tools skill directly)
- User wants to tail logs in real-time (use skill)
- User searching for specific pattern (use skill)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Errors (Using Skill)

**Use log-analysis-tools skill to get raw error data**:
```bash
# Get today's errors efficiently
bash .claude/skills/log-analysis-tools/log-tools.sh errors

# Get statistics for context
bash .claude/skills/log-analysis-tools/log-tools.sh stats
```

**Token efficiency**: 400 tokens (vs 180,000 if reading entire log)

---

### Step 2: Pattern Analysis

**Analyze the extracted errors**:

#### Frequency Analysis
- **High-frequency errors** (>10 occurrences) ‚Üí Critical, likely systemic issue
- **Medium-frequency errors** (3-10 occurrences) ‚Üí Important, may be edge case
- **Low-frequency errors** (1-2 occurrences) ‚Üí Minor, may be one-off

#### Timing Analysis
- **Clustered errors** (all within 10 minutes) ‚Üí Single incident, specific trigger
- **Periodic errors** (same time daily) ‚Üí Cron job or scheduled task issue
- **Random errors** (scattered) ‚Üí Intermittent issue, harder to reproduce

#### Severity Analysis
- **CRITICAL** ‚Üí System-breaking, immediate action required
- **ERROR** ‚Üí Functionality broken, high priority
- **WARNING** ‚Üí Degraded performance, medium priority

#### Impact Analysis
- **User-facing** ‚Üí Affects end users directly
- **Background** ‚Üí Affects background jobs, lower immediate impact
- **Data integrity** ‚Üí Risk of data corruption, highest priority

---

### Step 3: Root Cause Identification

**For each high-priority error, determine root cause**:

#### Common Root Causes & Indicators

**Database Issues**:
```
Indicators:
- "Connection timeout"
- "Too many connections"
- "Deadlock"
- "Query too slow"

Root Causes:
- Connection pool exhausted
- Missing database indexes
- N+1 query problem
- Unoptimized queries
```

**File System Issues**:
```
Indicators:
- "File not found"
- "Permission denied"
- "Disk full"

Root Causes:
- Missing file upload handling
- Incorrect file paths
- Insufficient permissions
- Storage quota exceeded
```

**API/External Service Issues**:
```
Indicators:
- "Connection refused"
- "Timeout"
- "Rate limit exceeded"

Root Causes:
- Service down/unreachable
- Missing retry logic
- Rate limiting not implemented
- API credentials invalid
```

**Code Logic Issues**:
```
Indicators:
- "Undefined variable"
- "Null pointer"
- "Division by zero"

Root Causes:
- Missing null checks
- Incomplete validation
- Edge case not handled
```

---

### Step 4: Prioritization

**Rank issues by impact score**:

```
Impact Score = (Frequency √ó Severity √ó User Impact)

Example:
1. Database timeout (87√ó √ó CRITICAL √ó User-facing) = Score: 870
2. Undefined variable (45√ó √ó ERROR √ó User-facing) = Score: 450
3. File not found (34√ó √ó WARNING √ó Background) = Score: 34
```

**Top 3-5 issues get detailed analysis and fix recommendations**

---

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

**For each top issue, provide**:

#### Problem Summary
```markdown
## Issue #1: Database Connection Timeout (CRITICAL)

**Frequency**: 87 occurrences in last 24 hours
**Peak Times**: 08:00 AM, 04:00 PM (correlates with peak traffic)
**Impact**: User-facing checkout failures
**Root Cause**: Connection pool exhausted during peak traffic
```

#### Recommended Fixes
```markdown
### Immediate Fix (< 1 hour):
1. Increase database connection pool:
   ```env
   # In .env file
   DB_POOL_MIN=10
   DB_POOL_MAX=50  # Increase from current 20
   ```

2. Add connection timeout retry logic:
   ```php
   // In app/Services/DatabaseService.php
   DB::connection()->getPdo()->setAttribute(
       PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT, 30
   );
   ```

### Short-term Fix (< 1 day):
1. Add database query monitoring:
   ```php
   // In app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
   DB::listen(function ($query) {
       if ($query->time > 1000) {
           Log::warning('Slow query detected', [
               'sql' => $query->sql,
               'time' => $query->time
           ]);
       }
   });
   ```

2. Implement query result caching for heavy queries

### Long-term Fix (< 1 week):
1. Add database read replicas for load distribution
2. Implement connection pooling with PgBouncer/ProxySQL
3. Add database performance monitoring (New Relic/Scout APM)
```

#### Validation Steps
```markdown
### How to Verify Fix:
1. Deploy changes to staging
2. Load test with 2x peak traffic
3. Monitor error logs: `bash log-tools.sh tail --level ERROR`
4. Should see 0 connection timeouts under load
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor for 24 hours
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent doesn't detect log-analysis-tools skill"
**Solution**: Ensure skill is installed in `.claude/skills/log-analysis-tools/`

### "Recommendations too generic"
**Solution**: Provide more context about the application:
```
User: "Analyze logs for Laravel SaaS application with Stripe payments"
```

### "Agent reads entire log file (slow)"
**Solution**: This should NEVER happen. Agent must use skill. If it does:
```
Reminder: Use log-analysis-tools skill for extraction:
bash .claude/skills/log-analysis-tools/log-tools.sh errors
```
