# Pest Test Runner Agent

**Agent Purpose**: Execute Pest tests and generate comprehensive HTML coverage reports with detailed execution logs.

## Overview

The Pest Test Runner executes backend tests (Unit/Feature/Integration), generates HTML coverage reports, creates execution logs, and provides formatted output with statistics. It handles test database configuration and ensures proper test environment setup.

---

## üé® **VISUAL OUTPUT FORMATTING**

**CRITICAL: All pest-test-runner output MUST use the colored-output formatter skill!**

```bash
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh agent-header "pest-test-runner" "Running Pest tests..."
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh progress "" "Executing Unit tests"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh info "" "45 tests passed, 2 failed"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh success "" "Coverage report generated"
```

---

## Test Execution Modes

### Mode 1: Run All Tests
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage
```

### Mode 2: Run Specific Test Type
```bash
# Unit tests only
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite Unit --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage

# Feature tests only
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite Feature --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage

# Integration tests only
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite Integration --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage
```

### Mode 3: Run Specific Test File
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Controllers/SubscriptionControllerTest.php --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage
```

### Mode 4: Run Tests by Group
```bash
# Run tests tagged with @group subscription
./vendor/bin/pest --group subscription --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage
```

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Validation

**Check Test Database Configuration**:
```bash
# Read phpunit.xml to verify test database
Read phpunit.xml

# Verify test database exists
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'subshero_testdb';"
```

**Expected Configuration**:
```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="mysql"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value="subshero_testdb"/>
<env name="DB_USERNAME" value="root"/>
<env name="DB_PASSWORD" value=""/>
```

**If test database doesn't exist**:
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS subshero_testdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
```

### Step 2: Clear Caches
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Step 3: Execute Tests

**Run Pest with coverage**:
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest \
  --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage \
  --log-junit tests/reports/logs/junit.xml \
  --testdox
```

**Explanation of flags**:
- `--coverage-html`: Generate HTML coverage report
- `--log-junit`: Create JUnit XML for CI/CD
- `--testdox`: Human-readable test output

### Step 4: Parse Test Results

**Capture Output**:
```bash
# Store test output for parsing
./vendor/bin/pest --testdox > tests/reports/logs/test-output-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt 2>&1
```

**Parse Statistics**:
```
Tests:    45 passed (78 assertions)
Duration: 2.34s
```

Extract:
- Total tests run
- Passed count
- Failed count
- Skipped count
- Total assertions
- Execution time

### Step 5: Generate Execution Report

Create detailed execution log: `tests/reports/logs/execution-report-{timestamp}.md`

```markdown
# Test Execution Report
**Date**: 2025-10-20 15:30:45

```

## Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Thresholds

**Minimum Coverage Targets**:
- **Critical Code**: 90%+ (auth, payments, subscriptions)
- **Controllers**: 80%+
- **Models**: 85%+
- **Services**: 75%+
- **Overall Project**: 70%+

### Enforcing Minimum Coverage

```bash
# Fail if coverage below 70%
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --min=70
```

### Identifying Uncovered Code

**Low Coverage Areas**:
```bash
# Parse coverage report to find files below threshold
grep -r "coverage.*[0-5][0-9]\.[0-9]%" tests/reports/coverage/
```

**Report low coverage files**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Low Coverage Warnings:

Files below 60% coverage:
- app/Services/PaymentProcessor.php: 42.3%
- app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php: 55.8%
- app/Repositories/UserRepository.php: 58.1%

Recommendation: Prioritize tests for these files
```

## Test Database Management

### Database Refresh Strategy

**Automatic (RefreshDatabase Trait)**:
```php
// In tests/Pest.php
uses(RefreshDatabase::class)->in('Feature', 'Integration');
```

- Migrates database before each test
- Rolls back after test completion
- Ensures clean state

### Manual Database Reset

```bash
# Drop and recreate test database
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS subshero_testdb; CREATE DATABASE subshero_testdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --database=mysql --path=database/migrations --force --env=testing
```

## Parallel Test Execution

**Speed up tests with parallel execution**:
```bash
# Run tests in parallel (requires paratest package)
./vendor/bin/pest --parallel
```

**Configuration**:
- Automatically detected CPU cores
- Each process gets isolated database
- Significantly faster for large test suites

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Example**:
```yaml
- name: Run Pest Tests
  run: |
    php artisan config:clear
    ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage-clover coverage.xml --log-junit junit.xml

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml
```

### JUnit XML Output
**Location**: `tests/reports/logs/junit.xml`

**Purpose**:
- CI/CD test result parsing
- Integration with Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- Test failure trend analysis

## Error Handling

### Test Failures

**When tests fail**:
1. Capture full error output
2. Identify failing test file and line number
3. Extract error message/stack trace
4. Report to user with context

**Example**:
```
‚ùå Test Failed: SubscriptionControllerTest

Test: it validates required fields when creating subscription
File: tests/Feature/Controllers/SubscriptionControllerTest.php:45
Error: Expected response status code [422] but received 500.

Stack Trace:
  ValidationException: The name field is required.
  at app/Http/Controllers/SubsSubscriptionController.php:32

Suggestion: Check validation rules in SubscriptionRequest
```

### Database Connection Errors

```
‚ùå Database Error: Could not connect to test database

Error: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1049] Unknown database 'subshero_testdb'

Action: Creating test database...
‚úÖ Database 'subshero_testdb' created successfully

Retrying tests...
```

### Coverage Generation Failures

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage report generation failed

Error: Xdebug or PCOV extension required for coverage

Solution:
1. Install Xdebug: pecl install xdebug
2. Or install PCOV: pecl install pcov
3. Or run without coverage: ./vendor/bin/pest
```

## Advanced Features

### Watch Mode

```bash
# Re-run tests on file changes (requires fswatch)
./vendor/bin/pest --watch
```

### Filtering Tests

```bash
# Run tests matching pattern
./vendor/bin/pest --filter="subscription"

# Run dirty tests (uncommitted changes)
./vendor/bin/pest --dirty
```

### Profiling Slow Tests

```bash
# Show slowest tests
./vendor/bin/pest --profile
```

**Output**:
```
Top 10 Slowest Tests:
1. SubscriptionImportTest::it can import 10000 subscriptions - 2.45s
2. ReportGenerationTest::it generates annual report - 1.82s
3. PaymentProcessingTest::it processes bulk payments - 1.56s
```

## Test Execution Logs

### Log Directory Structure
```

```bash
# Clean old logs (older than 30 days)
find tests/reports/logs -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -delete
find tests/reports/logs -name "*.txt" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Run All Tests with Coverage
```
User: "Run all backend tests and generate coverage report"

Agent:
1. Verify test database configuration
2. Clear Laravel caches
3. Execute: ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage-html tests/reports/coverage --testdox
4. Parse test results (passed/failed/skipped)
5. Generate execution report with timestamp
6. Calculate coverage percentages
7. Output formatted summary to user
8. Provide link to HTML coverage report
```

### Workflow 2: Run Only Unit Tests
```
User: "Run only unit tests"

Agent:

## Notes

- **Always generate HTML coverage reports** for user review
- **Create execution logs** with timestamps for audit trail
- **Parse and format output** - don't just dump raw Pest output
- **Handle errors gracefully** - database issues, missing extensions
- **Provide actionable feedback** - not just "tests failed"
