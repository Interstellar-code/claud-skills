## Matrix Design Philosophy

**Inspired by The Matrix trilogy:**
- Green on black color scheme
- Falling code (digital rain)
- Glitch effects (reality breaking)
- CRT scanlines (vintage monitors)
- Terminal UI (command-line aesthetic)
- Red/Blue pills (the choice)

**Easter eggs:**
- Katakana characters (from the films)
- "RED_PILL_INIT://" prefixes (V3)
- "SYSTEM STATUS: BREACH DETECTED" (V3)
- Corner targeting brackets (Neo's vision)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Digital rain not animating?**
- Check JavaScript is enabled
- Verify Canvas API support
- Check `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

**Poor mobile performance?**
- Use V1 (no canvas)
- Set V3 to LOW intensity
- Enable battery saver

**Text hard to read?**
- Increase brightness
- Use V3 LOW intensity
- Check high-contrast mode
